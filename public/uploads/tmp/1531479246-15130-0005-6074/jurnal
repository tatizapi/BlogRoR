Start: aprox. 11:00
End: 17:00
We started by visiting the company. After that we had a little talk with out mentor, Roxana, about the activities we're going to have during the internship. We exchange skype contacts between each other and also between the company's staff. During the day, we set up the environment, that is, installing ruby and rails. For the rest of the day we went through code academy tutorial on ruby. (I left at "looping with ruby" chapter).
